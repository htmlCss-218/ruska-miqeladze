            <p> World War I[j] or the First World War (28 July 1914 â€“ 11 November 1918), also known as the Great War, was a global conflict between two coalitions: the Allies (or Entente) and the Central Powers. Fighting took place mainly in Europe and the Middle East, as well as in parts of Africa and the Asia-Pacific,
                 and in Europe was characterised by trench warfare and the use of artillery, 
                machine guns, and chemical weapons (gas). World War I was one of the deadliest conflicts in history, resulting in an estimated 9 million military dead and 23 million wounded, plus up to 8 million civilian deaths from causes including genocide. The movement 
                of large numbers of people was a major factor in the Spanish flu pandemic, which killed millions.

            <p> The causes of World War I included the rise of Germany and decline of the Ottoman Empire, which disturbed the long-standing balance of power in Europe, as well as economic competition between nations triggered by industrialisation and imperialism. Growing tensions between the great powers and in the Balkans reached a breaking point on 28 June 1914, when a Bosnian Serb named Gavrilo Princip assassinated Archduke Franz Ferdinand, heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne. Austria-Hungary held Serbia responsible, 
                and declared war on 28 July. After Russia mobilised in Serbia's defence, Germany declared war on Russia; by 4 August, France and the United Kingdom were drawn in, with the Ottomans joining in November. Germany's strategy in 1914 was to quickly defeat France, then to transfer its forces to the east. However,
                 this failed, and by the end of the year the Western Front consisted of a continuous line of trenches stretching from the English Channel to Switzerland. The Eastern Front was more dynamic, but neither side gained a decisive advantage, 
                despite costly offensives. Italy, Bulgaria, Romania, Greece and others joined in from 1915 onward.</p>
